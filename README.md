Projects done during classes at UC Berkeley

**ATAXX: A two person game involving playing red/black pieces on a board with the goal of ending the game with the most pieces**
Important:
- Game saves previous moves/gamestates and allow the player to undo a move and everything that happened because of it
- AI that performs Minimax algorithm to take optimal moves, alpa/beta pruning to use less computation
- Extensive testing to make sure AI is optimal and user cannot break the game

**ENIGMA: The WW2 cipher machine used by the germans but using object-oriented programming to emulate the rotors and reflectors**
Important:
- Enigma will take an initial settings input and then tranlate text from that point, adjusting the rotors with each letter, like the real enigma
- Use of object-oriented programming and inheritance for moving/fixed rotors and reflectors

**GITLET: A simpler version of git version control without remote repository capabilities**
Important: 
- Implemented command line arguments just like actual git
- Serialized files, commit structure, and individual commits to allow for reuse of repository
- Object oriented programming to abstract code for commits and the staging area
